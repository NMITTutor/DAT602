## Week1
 This week we looked into the course outline and were introduced to the main content of the course.
 
 The course is based around an assignment with SQL
 
 We are to make a SQL based game that uses tiles for movement. 
 My theme is crypto currency and the aim of the game is to collect the coins when they appear which also includes multiplier bonuses that randomly appear. 
 
 I have installed the required MYSQL community package and configured to run on localhost:3000
